# RestaurantCateringApp
Created a restaurant catering app through andriod studios.
Coded in Java.
This project helped me touch base with JSON, as well as utlizing url code for buttons.
Also helped utilize firebase and grasping an understanding of creating a database in realtime and pulling information via internet.
This project really helped me grow my knowledge with different aspects in coding with java.
